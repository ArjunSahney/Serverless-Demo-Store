# 01 - Deploying the frontend

## Goal

In this lesson we will learn the basics of S3 and how to deploy a Single Page Application using S3.

We will learn:

  - How to create an S3 bucket
  - How to copy files into the bucket
  - How to expose the content of the bucket as a public website
  - How to configure the bucket policies


## The frontend

We have already a frontend application developed as a Single Page Application (SPA).

The code is available in [`src/frontend`](/src/frontend/).


TODO: ...

  - Describe how to run it locally
  - Explain that for now it uses mocked data, we will need to build a serverless backend
  - Brief overview of the various sections and expected functionality


Run locally:

```bash
npx http-server src/frontend -o
```
