# 09 - Extras


## YEAH! ü§ò

If you are reading this page you probably completed the workshop... If so, well done!

In this page you have some ideas for improving the application and for further learning.

I hope you had fun along the way and that's just the beginning of your Serverless fun!


## Ideas for further improvements:

- Instead of using S3 websites, use [AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) to serve your frontend application on a CDN (globally distributed and with support for HTTPS).
- Instead of creating your frontend S3 bucket and the DynamoDB table from CLI, try to do that in your SAM template.
- Improve the `listGigs` API to support pagination
- Create a new DynamoDB table for tracking purchased tickets and store them (you can also store the delivery state for sending the ticket via email)
- Manage tickets availability and make so that a customer can't purchase tickets for sold-out events (this might require changes also in the frontend)
- If you want to get very fancy you can also create a system that locks a ticket for a given amount of time while the user is filling the form for the purchase.
- Integrate a real payment system like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/ie) or [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/) in the purchase API and process the payments against them (of course in test mode üòá)
- Configure [AWS SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) to send real emails
- Create a nicer template email. You could add information about the concert, the date and where to go. You could also create a QRCode containing the ticket id.
- There are many other architectures and AWS services that can allow you to have a queue of messages to process. You might want to have a look at [DynamoDB streams](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.Lambda.html) and [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/).


## Cleaning up

If you want to delete all the resources created during this workshop from your aws account, you can do so with:

```bash
sam delete --stack-name=timelessmusic
```

Then remember to delete the `gig` DynamoDB table and the S3 bucket containing our frontend. The easiest way to do this is through the AWS Web interface.


That's all!

Well done again for getting so far! üëè
